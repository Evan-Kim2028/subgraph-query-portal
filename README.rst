==========
Subgraph Query Portal
==========

This library is a collection of reusable public goods Subgraph queriess to obtain cross-chain data for researchers and tool builders powered by `Messari Subgraph Endpoints <https://subgraphs.messari.io/>`__, 


Tools
==========
This project utilizes Subgraph endpoints from `Messari <https://messari.io/report/the-graph-foundation-awards-messari-usd12-5mm-in-first-ever-core-subgraph-developer-grant-to-build-and-standardize-subgraphs>`__ 
and `Subgrounds <https://docs.playgrounds.network/>`__, an open-source Python library built by `Playgrounds <https://playgrounds.network/>`__. 
Data is transformed using `Polars <https://github.com/pola-rs/polars>`__.

Subgraphs
---------
Subgraphs are custom APIs built on indexed blockchain data that can be queried using GraphQL endpoints. A list of Messari Endpoints can be found `here https://subgraphs.messari.io`__.

Subgrounds
----------
Subgrounds is an open-source Python library for interfacing with and querying Subgraphs. 
It simplifies the process of extracting and processing data from various blockchains.

Polars
------
Polars is a blazingly fast DataFrames library implemented in Rust using Apache Arrow Columnar Format as the memory model.

Library Requirements
============
* Python 3.10 or higher
* Subgrounds
* Polars
* Pyarrow


Installation
============

1. Install virtualenv:

   .. code:: bash

      python -m venv .venv
      source .venv/bin/activate

2. Install from github source:

   .. code:: bash

      pip install git+https://github.com/Evan-Kim2028/subgraph-query-portal.git


Making Changes to Source Code
=============================
1. Enable editable mode. Instructs pip to install the package in a way that allows you to make changes to the package's source code and have those changes take effect immediately

   .. code:: bash

      pip install -e .
